# Studio MVP (P3) — Plan

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | Planned 2026-11-03. P2 done (mac-engine.md) except the user's hands-on Mac test |
| Scope | cross-platform.md §5.2 P3: ReBuzz's studio UI on Avalonia, Mac first. Windows keeps the WPF app until P4 |
| Exit | On a Mac: compose a song from scratch with Neo and Pedal machines; old songs open (native machines as placeholders) and save back without loss; the MCP server works in studio mode |
| Related | cross-platform.md (D1–D5, §3.1 O2), mac-engine.md (the engine on macOS), machines.md §4 (the Neo editor kit), session-view.md (the Session View) |

## 1. Constraints

1. **Free components only.** Avalonia itself is MIT, free for commercial use too. The studio uses only it and other MIT or Apache packages. It does not use:
   - Avalonia XPF;
   - the Pro controls (TreeDataGrid, Charts, Rich Text, PDF, Media Player…);
   - the Plus tooling (DevTools, Parcel, Hot Reload, the Visual Studio extension).

   Pricing as of 2026-11: <https://avaloniaui.net/pricing>.
2. **No paid signing in P3.** The Mac app is built unsigned by CI. It runs after `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`. A Developer ID ($99 a year) is needed only for notarized distribution (P5), and it's optional.
3. **The engine doesn't change for the UI**, except through seams (P1) that the WPF app also uses.
4. **Windows stays on WPF** until P4. Nothing here may break `ReBuzz.exe`, its tests or its package.

## 2. Shape

| Project | What | Builds on |
|---|---|---|
| `ReBuzz.Host` (new, net10.0) | The engine start-up `rebuzz-headless` does today (settings, seams, steps 1–6, audio, MIDI, Link, agent). Shared by the headless app and the studio | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| `ReBuzz.Studio` (new, net10.0, Avalonia 12.1) | The app: shell, views, dialogs, the Avalonia seams (`IUiDispatcher`, `IUserMessages`, `IFileNameChoice`, `IKeyboard`, `IMachineUiHost`) | all three; shipped for macOS |
| `ReBuzz.Studio.Tests` (new) | Avalonia.Headless (NUnit): views render to PNG and take input, on Linux CI | Linux, macOS |
| `NeoBuzz.Editor.Avalonia` (new) | The Neo editor kit on Avalonia: an `INeoCanvas` backend and the kit's controls with the WPF kit's API | all three |
| Neo machines, studio flavour | Each Neo machine built `net10.0` with its editor on the Avalonia kit, into the studio's Gear (the portable flavour stays for `rebuzz-headless`) | all three |
| Pedal machines, portable | The 19 Pedal machines (ExternalMachines/source/thepedal) built `net10.0`, without their WPF GUIs: they get the generic parameter window | all three |

## 3. Decisions

1. **Avalonia 12.1** (MIT), Fluent theme in dark mode, plus our palette.
   - There is one built-in dark theme. ReBuzz's colour keys (`ThemeColors`) stay as data, so views read the same keys as on Windows.
   - The runtime XAML themes aren't ported.
2. **Code-drawn views port nearly line for line.** These are the machine view, the sequence editor, the pattern editor, the Session View and the Neo kit. WPF's `OnRender`/`DrawingContext`/`FormattedText` map onto Avalonia's. XAML views and styles are rewritten (Avalonia uses selectors, not triggers).
3. **Pure logic moves to portable classes** where porting a view shows it is mixed in: geometry, hit testing, selection, edit commands. Tests run on Linux. The WPF views keep their code until P4 switches Windows over.
4. **Machine GUIs on the Mac:**
   - Neo machines show their own editors, through the Avalonia kit.
   - Other managed machines show the generic parameter window. Their WPF GUIs don't load there.
   - Native machines are placeholders, with no GUI.
   - The machine API's `IMachineGUI` is already toolkit-free: the studio's `IMachineUiHost` expects an Avalonia control.
5. **One sequence editor: the horizontal one** (ModernSequenceEditorHorizontal), an arrangement timeline as in Ableton's arrangement view. Windows' default is the vertical one; P4 can add it.
6. **The pattern editor is the Modern Pattern Editor, ported.**
   - Its machine side (the pattern data, PXP, playback) builds `net10.0`.
   - Its view moves to Avalonia.
   - Until then, the Session View's piano roll edits notes in the engine's own columns. Off Windows, patterns have no editor machine (mac-engine.md M2).
7. **Testing.**
   - Every view renders headless on Linux CI (Avalonia.Headless + Skia) to a PNG uploaded with the run, and takes simulated input in tests.
   - The Mac job builds the app bundle, and starts it headless, once per PR into main.
8. **The dev loop builds locally.** The workspace can't reach NuGet, so a workflow (`dev-nuget-cache.yml`) restores the studio's and the tests' packages on Linux and publishes them as one asset of a prerelease (`dev-nuget-cache`). A local build reads them as its only package source. This is tooling only: the product build restores from NuGet as usual.
9. **The app on the Mac in P3:**
   - CI publishes a self-contained osx-arm64 `ReBuzz.app` (zip) with PortAudio, libsndfile and the Link helper inside, unsigned.
   - It needs no .NET install.
   - Settings live in `~/Library/Application Support/ReBuzz`, as for `rebuzz-headless`.

## 4. Steps (PR-sized)

| # | PR | Needs | Exit check |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0 | **Foundations.** The dev NuGet cache; `ReBuzz.Host` (rebuzz-headless moves onto it, unchanged in behaviour); `ReBuzz.Studio` with the Avalonia seams, a main window (menu, transport bar, view tabs, status bar: CPU, dropouts), File new/open/save/save as, undo/redo, audio through PortAudio; `ReBuzz.Studio.Tests`; CI on Linux (build, headless tests, screenshots) and the Mac job (bundle, start) | – | The window renders headless with a song open; open → save round-trips a song; the bundle starts on macos-15 |
| S1 | **Neo editors.** `NeoBuzz.Editor.Avalonia`; the Neo machines' studio flavour; the studio's machine windows (`IMachineUiHost`) | S0 | Every Neo editor renders headless; a knob drag changes the parameter and undo restores it; screenshots match the WPF editors' layout |
| S2 | **Generic parameter window** and the portable Pedal machines | S0 | Every Pedal machine loads, plays and shows its parameters; a slider changes a value |
| S3 | **Machine view.** Machines and wires, add (gear menu), delete, rename, move, connect by drag, amp and pan on wires, mute/solo, open editor/parameters | S0 | Build a chain from an empty song with the mouse alone (headless input), and it renders as expected |
| S4 | **Sequence editor** (horizontal). Tracks, pattern blocks, place/move/delete, loop and song end markers, play cursor | S0 | Arrange patterns, play, the cursor follows; save and reopen keep it |
| S5 | **Session View and mixer.** The WPF Session View's code-drawn grid, clip panel, piano roll, mixer, sends, meters | S0 | Launch, record a take, mix; the Session View's existing tests' scenarios as headless UI tests |
| S6 | **Modern Pattern Editor.** Its machine side portable, its view on Avalonia | S0 | Write notes and automation with the keyboard; songs with PXP data open and save unchanged |
| S7 | **Preferences and the rest of the shell.** Audio device and buffer, MIDI inputs/outputs, sync (clock, Link), theme colours, recent files, autosave recovery, keyboard shortcuts, the Mac menu bar | S0 | Every setting round-trips; shortcuts work headless |
| S8 | **MCP studio mode.** The agent's HTTP server with its token, as on Windows (Settings → Agent) | S0, S7 | `claude mcp add` against the studio; the A7 live tests' scenarios pass against it |
| S9 | **The exit test**, on CI and by hand: a song from scratch; old songs (Windows-made, natives as placeholders) open and save back | S1–S8 | §5 |

S1 to S6 are independent once S0 is in: they run in parallel, each in its own branch, and each adds one view to the shell.

## 5. What only the user can do

- **Try it on a Mac:** download the CI's `ReBuzz.app`, clear the quarantine flag, open it. The feel matters here: scrolling, fonts, Retina, keyboard shortcuts. So does the menu bar.
- **The exit test by hand:** a song from scratch, and an old song of yours.
- **Signing** (optional, P5): a Developer ID, if the app should open without the quarantine step on other Macs.

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| The Modern Pattern Editor is the largest port (12k LOC, its own rendering) | S6 runs long | It is last and independent; the Session View's piano roll covers notes meanwhile |
| Custom-drawn views are slow on Avalonia (the pattern and sequence editors redraw a lot) | sluggish UI | Draw in layers (static grid cached, cursor separately), as the WPF views do; measure in headless tests |
| WPF habits that don't port (triggers, `DependencyProperty` metadata, adorners) | rework | Port by behaviour, not by XAML; keep the code-drawn parts as they are |
| No local NuGet | slow loop | §3.8 |
| Mac-only behaviour (menu bar, Retina, keyboard) can't be seen in CI | surprises on the user's Mac | A Mac CI start-up check; the user's try-out after S0 and after S3 |

## 7. Progress

Nothing built yet.
